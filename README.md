# game
Simple mini-game.  
The player sees 12 boxes. They open box after box until a "Game over sign" appears. 
The boxes contain various rewards that are randomly divided between the boxes. 
The contents are:  
* 1x €100 
* 2x €20 
* 5x €5 
* 1x "Extra life". If one of these boxes are awarded, the next "Game over sign" is nullified. 
* 3x "Game over sign" - ends the game.   
  
When the game is over, the player gets an additional reward. It is chosen randomly from four options:  
* € 5
* €10
* €20
* "Second chance" - return to the game, shuffle cards and start from beginning. The next time the game finishes, the "Second chance" option is disabled (only the three above options are available)
